The objective of this project is to detect the cat and dog respectively in each given images, 
and display the name of the respective animal along the bounding box.

This Repository has a .ipynb file which has end to end code that reads, trains and predicts the cat and dog images.


Data Source: 
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tarunbisht11/yolo-animal-detection-small?select=yolo-animal-detection-small).
And also took some real world images.
Total of 2000 images with 1000 each of cat and dog images.


Model Used:
Used the YOLO v5(You Only Look Once) model which pre-trained model.
There is only a single network evaluation unlike the previous systems like the R-CNN approach which required thousands of evaluations for a single image.
YOLO-v5 is very light weight and runs much faster than YOLO-v4. 
YOLO-v5 is almost as accurate as YOLO v4 but a bit less efficient than YOLO v4.
